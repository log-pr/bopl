version 1.1.0

mod now only applies to non-local players

next updates will likely include further optimization (does not need to be called every frame like it currently does) and potentially a config file with more options like which sprite is used or disabling the cooldown indicator.

version 1.0.0

first working version of mod

this mod changes the sprite of all abilities attached to players to a "?" sprite so nobody knows what abilities anyone has.
once the ability is dropped on death, its original sprite is still visible.

extensive testing has not been performed yet, will need to be.

planning on adding config options in later versions that allow for options like hiding only non-local player sprites, hiding the ability's sprite on drop, etc.
